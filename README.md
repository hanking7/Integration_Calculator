# Integration_Calculator

Developed a C++ definite integration calculator using Riemann sum, trapezoid rule, and Simpson's rule to compare approximation errors between methods.
Implemented data handling and calculation algorithms to evaluate the accuracy of each integration approach, improving understanding of numerical analysis techniques.
